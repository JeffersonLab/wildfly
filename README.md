# wildfly [![Docker (demo)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/jeffersonlab/wildfly?sort=semver&label=DockerHub)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jeffersonlab/wildfly)
Configurable [Wildfly](https://www.wildfly.org/) base Docker image 

## Configure
Wildfly must be pre-configured before the first deployment of an app.  The bash scripts located in the `scripts` directory are used with the following environment variables:

Create a `.env` file for your environment and call the bash scripts [server-setup.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/server-setup.sh) (example: [docker config](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/config/docker-server.env)) and [app-setup.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/app-setup.sh) (example: [demo docker config](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/smoothness/blob/main/docker/demo/smoothness-demo-setup.env)) to do the initial Wildfly configuration.   Bash can be executed on Linux, Windows (WSL2), and Mac with some perseverance.  See [bash setup scripts](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/tree/main/scripts).

**Note**: If you are using Windows and WSL2 you may need to run dos2unix on .env and .sh files

**Note**: As an alternative to the bash scripts The docker image configures Wildfly for use in the compose environment and that's a good starting point to copy from.  Outside of a compose environment you may need to tweak the standalone.xml configuration to use different host names and ports (For example Oracle and Keycloak host names would need to be updated to localhost:1521 and localhost:8081 respectively when using the deps.yml and running Wildfly outside the compose network):

```
docker compose up
docker exec -it demo /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect -c "undeploy smoothness-demo.war"
docker exec -it demo /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect -c shutdown
docker cp demo:/opt/jboss/wildfly .
```
