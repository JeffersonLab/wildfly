## Overview
This Jefferson Lab Wildfly template assumes apps are authenticated with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and use an Oracle database.  Optionally an SMTP mail server can be configured.   The full EE Wildfly distribution is used as a starting point and a few libraries are added including:

 - JLog: JLab logbook client
 - Keycloak admin client
 - Apache POI (Excel doc API)
 - Tuckey URL rewrite

## Configure
Wildfly must be pre-configured before the first deployment of an app.  The bash scripts located in the `scripts` directory are used with the following environment variables:

Create a `.env` file for your environment and call the bash scripts [server-setup.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/server-setup.sh) (example: [docker config](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/config/docker-server.env)) and [app-setup.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/app-setup.sh) (example: [demo docker config](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/smoothness/blob/main/docker/demo/smoothness-demo-setup.env)) to do the initial Wildfly configuration.   Bash can be executed on Linux, Windows (WSL2), and Mac with some perseverance.  See [bash setup scripts](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/tree/main/scripts).

**Note**: If you are using Windows and WSL2 you may need to run dos2unix on .env and .sh files

### Server Setup 
Only needs to be executed once per permanent installation of Wildfly.

**Note**: As an alternative to the bash scripts The docker image configures Wildfly for use in the compose environment and that's a good starting point to copy from.  Outside of a compose environment you may need to tweak the standalone.xml configuration to use different host names and ports (For example Oracle and Keycloak host names would need to be updated to localhost:1521 and localhost:8081 respectively when using the deps.yml and running Wildfly outside the compose network):

```
docker compose up
docker exec -it demo /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect -c "undeploy smoothness-demo.war"
docker exec -it demo /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect -c shutdown
docker cp demo:/opt/jboss/wildfly .
```
### Docker Runtime

These environment variables are Docker specific and are used by the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh) script to wait on the Oracle database to start.

## Release
1. Create a new release on the GitHub Releases page.  The release should enumerate changes and link issues.
2. Build and publish a new Docker image [from the GitHub tag](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/a7da801e8259f5974c978f9c3091d52c#8-build-an-image-based-of-github-tag). GitHub is configured to do this automatically on git push of semver tag (typically part of GitHub release) or the [Publish to DockerHub](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml) action can be manually triggered after selecting a tag.
