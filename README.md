## Overview
This Jefferson Lab Wildfly template assumes apps are authenticated with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and use an Oracle or MariaDB database.  It is generally expected that only one database will be configured at a time.  Optionally an SMTP mail server can be configured.   The full EE Wildfly distribution is used as a starting point and a few libraries are added including:

 - JLog: JLab logbook client
 - Keycloak admin client
 - Apache POI (Excel doc API)
 - Tuckey URL rewrite

## Configure
Wildfly must be pre-configured before the first deployment of an app.  The bash scripts located in the `scripts` directory are used with the following environment variables:

Create a `.env` file for your environment and call the bash scripts [server-setup.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/server-setup.sh) (example: [docker config](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/config/docker-server.env)) and [app-setup.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/app-setup.sh) (example: [demo docker config](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/smoothness/blob/main/docker/demo/smoothness-demo-setup.env)) to do the initial Wildfly configuration.   Bash can be executed on Linux, Windows (WSL2), and Mac with some perseverance.  See [bash setup scripts](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/tree/main/scripts).

**Note**: If you are using Windows and WSL2 you may need to run `dos2unix` on .env and .sh files

### Server Setup 
Only needs to be executed once per permanent installation of Wildfly.

**Note**: Runtime Overridable parameters only make sense for Wildfly instances used for a single app (such as in a Container).  Providing runtime overrides to a multi-app configuration would overwrite all app configs of the same name.  See https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/86df35a1357b5ad863ecc53be94676bf96ef8489/scripts/app-setup.sh#L69

**Note**: As an alternative to the bash scripts The docker image configures Wildfly for use in the compose environment and that's a good starting point to copy from.  Outside a compose environment you may need to tweak the standalone.xml configuration to use different host names and ports (For example Oracle and Keycloak host names would need to be updated to localhost:1521 and localhost:8081 respectively when using the deps.yaml and running Wildfly outside the compose network):

```
docker compose up
docker exec -it demo /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect -c "undeploy smoothness-demo.war"
docker exec -it demo /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect -c shutdown
docker cp demo:/opt/jboss/wildfly .
```
### Docker Runtime

These environment variables are Docker specific and are used by the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh) script to wait on the Oracle database to start.

| Name               | Description                                                                                   |

| ORACLE_SERVER      | Host name and port of Oracle server to use to connect to DB from TestOracleConnection utility |
| ORACLE_USER        | Username to use to connect to DB from TestOracleConnection utility                            |
| ORACLE_PASS        | Password to use to connect to DB from TestOracleConnection utility                            |

| MARIADB_PASS       | Password to use to connect to DB from TestMariaDBConnection utility                           |
| MARIADB_DB_NANE    | MariaDB Service name to use to connect to DB from TestMariaDBConnection utility               |           

**Note**: The entrypoint script waits for either an Oracle or a MariaDB database to start but not both.  Oracle takes precedence.

## Release
1. Bump the version number in the VERSION file and commit and push to GitHub (using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)).
2. The [CD](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/wildfly/blob/main/.github/workflows/cd.yaml) GitHub Action should run automatically invoking:
    - The [Create release](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/container-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-release.yaml) GitHub Action to tag the source and create release notes summarizing any pull requests.   Edit the release notes to add any missing details.
    - The [Publish docker image](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/container-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yaml) GitHub Action to create a new demo Docker image.
